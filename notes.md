- too fast at the beginning (problem space)
    - start with basic examples -> go into graphql-client right away
    - basic example in graphql, then rust example next to it
- introduce why you want graphql (client can specify what it wants)
- jumping slides
- use the same schema for the whole talk
- move the usage example earlier
- what it generates
- it's just plain old structs and enums
- explain name generation better
- show which language the slide is in

- polacode
