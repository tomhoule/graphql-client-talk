### What?

<img src="./assets/evil_organization.png" />

<div>
<small>
    a GraphQL client
</small>
</div>

---

### Why?

<video
    autoPlay
    loop
    src="./assets/cat-box.mp4"
/>

<div>
no graphql client in Rust
</div>

---

### pure Rust (?)

<!-- no js dependencies -->
<!-- insert line counts with json here -->

```

### Question to the audience

<video
    autoPlay
    loop
    src="./assets/intermission.mp4"
/>

---

if a GraphQL query wore pants...

---

would it wear them like this

```rust
fn <Q>(
    variables: &Q::Variables
) -> Future<GraphQLQueryResult>
where Q: GraphQLQuery
```

---

or like this?

```rust
fn <Q>(
    query: Q,
    variables: &Q::Variables
) -> Future<GraphQLQueryResult>
where Q: GraphQLQuery
```
