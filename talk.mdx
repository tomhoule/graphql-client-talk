graphql-client

```notes
- name
- first time talking on a meetup
- I want to talk about a small library I started early June
```

---

### Why?

<video
    autoPlay
    loop
    src="./assets/cat-box.mp4"
/>

<div>
no graphql client in Rust
</div>

```notes
- If it fits, I sits
- I like GraphQL
- I had ideas about GraphQL servers
- Noticed there is no client in Rust
```

---

### pure Rust (?)

<!-- no js dependencies -->
<!-- insert line counts with json here -->

```
------------------------------------
 Language                    Lines
------------------------------------
 JSON                        47193
 Rust                         4782
------------------------------------
```

<small>counted with <a href="https://github.com/Aaronepower/tokei">tokei</a></small>

```notes
- even though the line count may suggest otherwise
- you might wonder why there is so much JSON
- let's backtrack a bit

- A query language and a specification for building APIs
- All the data you need for a view in one request (client-centric)
- Developed at Facebook, open sourced in 2015
- Very rich, growing ecosystem, fast adoption (Github, Shopify, Facebook, Twitter...)

```notes
- Technology for building APIs, with clients requesting data from a servers
- Spec defining two languages, a type system and the behaviour of servers
- One query -> query a graph objecst and fields
- Client-centric
  - Fetch exactly what you need
  - Nesting (post -> comment -> author -> posts)
- Makes it easy to evolve your API
- Transport agnostic, but most of the time JSON over HTTP
```

---

Example


![](./assets/github-graphiql-example.png)


```notes
- You get what you ask for (client-centric)
- Nesting -> you query an object tree
```

---

## Why you want a client library

- Correctness
- Take advantage of behaviour defined in the spec (error handling...)
- Caching
- *Strong typing*

```notes
- It's easy to make wrong requests
- That's a small part of the library
- No caching yet
- Strong typing is what I want to talk about
```

---

## How it works - introspection

- GraphQL is typed
- Introspection is defined by the spec and meant to be used for code generation
- With a GraphQL query and the schema, we can generate a struct for the response shape

```notes
- GraphQL has a type system - defined by the spec so it's shared between all server implementations
- You can ask a server, at runtime, what API it exposes (also in the spec)
- It returns a structured response you can generate code for a client from - think mini-SDK.
- Why you need both query and schema (selection)
```

```notes
- How do you combine the enum and the struct? You can't... but serde has got us covered
```

---

### Takeaways

- Serde is awesome
- Rust is really good at playing with other languages


```notes
- I don't think I could have done it without all the serde annotations
```

### Question to the audience

<CodeSurfer
  notes='if a GraphQL query wore pants...'

    { range: [1, 10], notes: 'would it wear them like this?'},
    { range: [11, 21], notes: 'or like this?'},
    { range: [1, 21], notes: 'vote' },
  ]}

---

### Conclusion: Learnings

---

### Be prepared for contributors

- Not enough time invested in a CONTRIBUTING.md
- Be ready to comment and review a lot
- I thought the library was ready at 0.1 (wrong)
- Underestimated the work - even for a small project like this
- Shoutout to all those who contributed, and in particular to @h-michael, @LegNeato and @mathstuf

- Other learning: the ecosystem
- We have a really awesome ecosystem of basic building blocks like serde
- We can build higher-level libraries on top
- In graphql, graphql-parser

### Error handling - failure

### Dependencies - cargo-edit

---

### Future

- clients everywhere!
- normalized cache shared between implementations
- build script, CLI and possibly proc macro-based codegen workflows
- codegen as an npm package
- better query validation
- friendlier error messages
- ...
